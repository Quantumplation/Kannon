    'VBTablet ITablet class - ©2001 Laurence Parry
    'This is the tablet interface. It should be implemented by applications
    'that wish to use the interface callback method of packet and event
    'notification, rather than VB events. This is faster (and may be
    'easier for non-VB clients to implement)

    'This is the abstract class. It is here to define the calls that can
    'be made by the component to the client program implementing this interface.
    '**Don't change it and then remake this DLL**
    'If you need to make changes, make an entirely new interface
    '(you should support the old one, too).

    'Signals the arrival of a tablet information packet. Not all values of information will be supported on all devices
